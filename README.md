# halley2RSS
A simple Python "scrape 'n feed" script. It's built for scraping data out of xml sites of Halleyweb systems (often used by italian public administrations to publish official documents and public notifications) and serve the data as RSS feeds.

I proudly built this for Ricostruzione Trasparente, a project monitoring public contracts in post-emergency contexts. Check it out! www.ricostruzionetrasparente.it and https://github.com/RicostruzioneTrasparente
